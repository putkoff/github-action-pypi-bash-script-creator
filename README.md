# github-action-pypi-bash-script-creator
This script prompts the user for the PyPI credentials, project folder, and tag using Zenity dialogs. It also reads from a .env file if it exists. The script sets up Git, pushes the tag, and creates and runs the GitHub Actions workflow to publish the package to PyPI.
